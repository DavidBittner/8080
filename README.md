# 8080 Emulator

Always wanted to write an emulator, think I'm knowledgeable about things now to give it a shot.

So, here goes!

# 8080 Coverage

This likely won't cover the full opset of the chip. I'm just aiming for emulation of Space Invaders.

# Future

I'm likely going to be using SDL for graphical rendering but I'll jump that hurdle when I get to it.

Input will definitely have to be handled by either SDL or OpenGL. OpenGL seems like a strange choice due to a lack of a rasterizing rendering system. Counter-intuitive when reading from something such as a video buffer.
