# 8080 Emulator

Always wanted to write an emulator, think I'm knowledgeable about things now to give it a shot.

So, here goes!

# 8080 Coverage

This likely won't cover the full opset of the chip. I'm just aiming for emulation of Space Invaders.

# Dependencies

* spdlog (which includes C++ fmt)

# Future

SDL will be used for input processing as well as graphical rendering, but we'll see if I get there.
